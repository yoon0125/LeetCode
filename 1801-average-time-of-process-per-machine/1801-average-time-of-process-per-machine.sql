/*
SELECT machine_id, processing_time

First Solution
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp-a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time 
from Activity a1
join Activity a2 
on a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id and a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.activity_type='start' and a2.activity_type='end'
group by a1.machine_id



Second Solution
select 
a.machine_id,
round(
      (select avg(a1.timestamp) from Activity a1 where a1.activity_type = 'end' and a1.machine_id = a.machine_id) - 
      (select avg(a1.timestamp) from Activity a1 where a1.activity_type = 'start' and a1.machine_id = a.machine_id)
,3) as processing_time
from Activity a
group by a.machine_id
*/

select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
from Activity as a1
inner join Activity as a2
on a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id and a1.process_id = a2.process_id
